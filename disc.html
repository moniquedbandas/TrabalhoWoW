        Discipline Priest Overview
        <br><br>
        Discipline Priest in Dragonflight is a masterful raid-wide burst healer with absorbs and damage reduction
        utility. They prepare for incoming damage by marking players with helpful buffs in Atonement that allow the
        Discipline Priest to deal substantial damage to the boss to create healing on those marked allies.
        <br>
        With this, there is a natural ebb and flow to Discipline's healing where they "ramp up" their Atonement
        counts to increase their healing and then rest between these ramps, providing minor healing in between their
        large bursts.
        <br>
        Discipline Priest Rework in 10.2
        <br><br>
        Discipline's revamp in 10.2 has substantially improved how Discipline deals damage to heal allies. Rolling
        Mindbender/ Shadowfiend into Shadow Covenant, adding more activators for Inescapable Torment and offering
        greater cooldown reduction for your pet with the synergy that the new 4pc's bonus Smites have with Void
        Summoner. The net result is a spec that plays around its pet to do burstier damage, both in significant AoE
        that is incredibly helpful in Mythic+, but also single-target that produces heavy Atonement output. It also
        shifts more power into Atonement healing in general making your mini-ramps, your Atonements applied with
        Power Word: Radiance charges in between Rapture/ Evangelism, significantly more impactful in pushing up
        health bars.
        <br>
        In downtime, your Penance and Smite are excellent contributors of damage but also cooldown reduction as
        mentioned before with Void Summoner. Allowing you important moments where you will want to cast many Smites
        to return your cooldown of Mindbender/ Shadowfiend rapidly for the next instance of damage that hits the
        raid so you can speedily top health bars again.
        <br>
        You also receive a new ability with synergistic talents in Ultimate Penitence which can provide a
        substantial amount of damage but also has some tremendous risks associated with it (see the rotation/talent
        sections).
        <br>
        More Facts and Background about Discipline Priest
        <br>
        Fantasy: 
        <br>A strong believer in the light - almost zealous in their belief, causing them to feel no remorse
        about damaging enemies of the light. A Discipline priest is a battle healer, smiting down their enemies in
        order to bravely save their allies. They have adopted the traits of both healing and shadow priests in order
        to make sure their allies stay alive. The main thing that makes Disc Priests truly special is Atonement.
        
        <br>
        Races:
        <br>
        All races can be Priests.
        <br>
        Resources:
        <br>
        Disc Priests use mana as their resource for spells.
        <br>
        Damage Reduction: Focused Will is a passive personal damage taken reduction from melee hits. Pain
        Suppression is a strong single target damage reduction spell as well as Power Word: Barrier being strong for
        a group setting.
        <br>
        Healing: Using their Power Words such as Power Word: Shield to shield allies and Power Word: Radiance to
        heal allies, Discipline Priests' true strength lies in Atonement which makes the damage you do, heal your
        allies.
        <br>
        Basic Rotation: Not overcapping Power Word: Radiance charges, maintaing Shadow Word: Pain on the primary
        enemy. Maintain Atonement on the tank, prepare large-scale Atonement on the party before incoming damage via
        or Power Word: Shield, then Power Word: Radiance, extend their duration with Evangelism then
        deal damage through Schism, Penance and Smite.

        Mobility: Angelic Feather and Body and Soul are both on the same talent row. These are used for mobility if
        needed.
        <br>
        Healing Cooldowns: Rapture is a strong Cooldown for Disc Priests. While it does no direct healing, it allows
        you to shield many members of your raid.
