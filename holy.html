        Holy Priest Overview
        <br>
        <br>
        Holy Priest in Dragonflight is a flexible healer bringing significant single-target and Area of Effect
        healing. In either situation you are spreading Healing Over Time effects from the specialization's Mastery
        Mastery: Echo of Light.
        <br>
        <br>
        They bring multiple raid cooldowns in Divine Hymn and Holy Word: Salvation along with defensive cooldown
        reduction in Symbol of Hope.
        <br>
        <br>
        Holy Priest Rework in Dragonflight Season 3:
        <br>
        <br>
        Holy Priest has received a number of adjustments for the spec in Season 3, most notably some heavy nerfs to
        their utility with Symbol of Hope's value being cut in half and Holy Word: Salvation's cooldown reduction
        cut in half as well. The new tier set somewhat helps in keeping Salv's cooldown low but it likely stops the
        cooldown from being utilized 3 times in most encounters.
        <br>
        Power Word: Life also was reworked to no longer be castable on an ally over 35% health. The upside is that
        it will never go on that punishing lengthier cooldown but the downside is that you may waste a GCD anyway
        trying to force this ability to work when a health pool can instantly snap back up quickly. Benevolence was
        added during Season 2 and looks to still be the default choice in PvE. Your single-target output in Flash
        Heal and Holy Word: Serenity was increased while Holy Word: Sanctify was nerfed to only heal 5 targets
        instead of 6. You will still focus on maximizing your Holy Word: Serenitys in dungeons and Holy Word:
        Sanctifys in raids though.
        <br>
