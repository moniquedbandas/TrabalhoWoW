            Shadow Priest Overview
            <br>
            <br>
            Shadow Priest is a ranged cloth dps specialisation with a mix of direct damage and damage over time spells.
            The spec predominantly focuses on dealing Shadow damage and most of its defensive capabilities are linked to
            its self healing. Priests in general are very slow, and Shadow is no exception with no baseline displacement
            or movement abilities you'll have to plan movement in encounters ahead of time, as well as use the few
            kiting tools you have available to their maximum advantage. Shadow Priests also have the ability to empower
            the damage of their allies, as well as themselves, and are a dps spec focused on dealing maximum damage in
            burst windows every minute with numerous stacked cooldowns.

            More Facts and Background about Shadow
            Fantasy: Shadow Priests are priests that use their ties to the void in order to cause pain and suffering to
            their enemies. Most of their spells are either related to hits directly into their foes minds, weakening
            them with every blow or tapping into the power of the void to strike their foes with ancient powers. Like
            other Priest specs, they have the option to heal their allies' wounds, but at a much more expensive cost.
            Shadow Priests can also convert the pain of their enemies into salvation for their allies, using vampiric
            rituals. The main thing that makes Shadow Priests truly special is Voidform.
            Resources: Shadow Priests use both Insanity and Mana as resources. As a Shadow Priest, you will be casting
            abilities which generate Insanity. Insanity can be spent using Devouring Plague or (Spell #48045). Mana is
            used to cast Flash Heal and Power Word: Shield.
            Mobility: Shadow Priests have a low level of mobility which can be increased slightly by either Body and
            Soul or Dispersion (not advised).
            AoE Capabilities: Multi-dotting with Shadow Word: Pain, Vampiric Touch, and using (Spell #48045) are how
            Shadow Priests cause damage to large groups of mobs.
            Defensive Abilities: Dispersion: The big personal cooldown for shadow. Baseline it's at 75% damage
            reduction. Lasts 6 seconds on a 2m cooldown. Very useful for surviving things that would otherwise kill you.
            Armor: Intellect Cloth
            Weaknesses: Shadow Priests are currently weak in burst AoE and ST situations
            Flavor: Priests have a variety of vanity glyphs:
            Glyph of the Heavens to float your Levitate targets on clouds
            Glyph of the Sha to change the appearance of your Shadowfiend
            Glyph of Shackle Undead to change the appearance of your Shackle Undead spell
            And some toys as well:
            Thaumaturgist's Orb: Summons holy orbs or ravens. Sold by Quartermaster Miranda Breechlock in Light's Hope.
            Scarlet Confessional Book: effect of old Glyph of Confession. Sold by Cravitz Lorent in Dalaran.
            What defines Priests who select the Shadow specialization is their signature ability Voidform. This gives
            allows the Priest to tap deeper into the powers of the Void should they choose to, giving a translucent
            appearance and making their void powers manifest to the outside world, with some tentacles as a side effect.

            Holy Priest Overview
            <br>
            <br>
            Holy Priest in Dragonflight is a flexible healer bringing significant single-target and Area of Effect
            healing. In either situation you are spreading Healing Over Time effects from the specialization's Mastery
            Mastery: Echo of Light.

            They bring multiple raid cooldowns in Divine Hymn and Holy Word: Salvation along with defensive cooldown
            reduction in Symbol of Hope.
            Holy Priest Rework in Dragonflight Season 3
            Holy Priest has received a number of adjustments for the spec in Season 3, most notably some heavy nerfs to
            their utility with Symbol of Hope's value being cut in half and Holy Word: Salvation's cooldown reduction
            cut in half as well. The new tier set somewhat helps in keeping Salv's cooldown low but it likely stops the
            cooldown from being utilized 3 times in most encounters.

            Power Word: Life also was reworked to no longer be castable on an ally over 35% health. The upside is that
            it will never go on that punishing lengthier cooldown but the downside is that you may waste a GCD anyway
            trying to force this ability to work when a health pool can instantly snap back up quickly. Benevolence was
            added during Season 2 and looks to still be the default choice in PvE. Your single-target output in Flash
            Heal and Holy Word: Serenity was increased while Holy Word: Sanctify was nerfed to only heal 5 targets
            instead of 6. You will still focus on maximizing your Holy Word: Serenitys in dungeons and Holy Word:
            Sanctifys in raids though.

            More Facts and Background about Holy Priest
            Fantasy: Healers that worship the power of the Light, Holy Priests use powerful healing spells to keep
            themselves and their allies healed through dire situations.
            Races: All races can be Priests.
            Resources: Holy Priests use mana as their resource for spells.
            Damage Reduction: Focused Will is a passive personal damage taken reduction from melee hits.
            Healing: Holy Word: Sanctify as well as Holy Word: Serenity are the Holy Priests bread and butter. Use other
            healing spells such as Prayer of Healing and Flash Heal to reduce the cooldown of your holy words.
            Basic Rotation: Holy Word: Sanctify and Holy Word: Serenity should be used as often as possible. Prayer of
            Mending and Circle of Healing on cooldown, utilizing AoE and Single Target healing to reduce your Holy Word
            cooldowns.
            Mobility: Angelic Feather provides Holy Priests with a on-demand sprint.
            Healing Cooldowns: Apart from your Holy Words, Divine Hymn is your main healing cooldown as well as Holy
            Word: Salvation if talented.
            Armor: Cloth
            Flavor: Priests have a variety of vanity glyphs:
            Glyph of the Heavens to float your Levitate targets on clouds
            Glyph of Shackle Undead to change the appearance of your Shackle Undead spell
            Glyph of Ghostly Fade to have a more spectral looking Fade!
            And some toys as well:
            Thaumaturgist's Orb: Summons holy orbs or ravens. Sold by Quartermaster Miranda Breechlock in Light's Hope.
            Scarlet Confessional Book: effect of old Glyph of Confession. Sold by Cravitz Lorent in Dalaran.

            Discipline Priest Overview
            <br><br>
            Discipline Priest in Dragonflight is a masterful raid-wide burst healer with absorbs and damage reduction
            utility. They prepare for incoming damage by marking players with helpful buffs in Atonement that allow the
            Discipline Priest to deal substantial damage to the boss to create healing on those marked allies.

            With this, there is a natural ebb and flow to Discipline's healing where they "ramp up" their Atonement
            counts to increase their healing and then rest between these ramps, providing minor healing in between their
            large bursts.
            Discipline Priest Rework in 10.2
            Discipline's revamp in 10.2 has substantially improved how Discipline deals damage to heal allies. Rolling
            Mindbender/ Shadowfiend into Shadow Covenant, adding more activators for Inescapable Torment and offering
            greater cooldown reduction for your pet with the synergy that the new 4pc's bonus Smites have with Void
            Summoner. The net result is a spec that plays around its pet to do burstier damage, both in significant AoE
            that is incredibly helpful in Mythic+, but also single-target that produces heavy Atonement output. It also
            shifts more power into Atonement healing in general making your mini-ramps, your Atonements applied with
            Power Word: Radiance charges in between Rapture/ Evangelism, significantly more impactful in pushing up
            health bars.

            In downtime, your Penance and Smite are excellent contributors of damage but also cooldown reduction as
            mentioned before with Void Summoner. Allowing you important moments where you will want to cast many Smites
            to return your cooldown of Mindbender/ Shadowfiend rapidly for the next instance of damage that hits the
            raid so you can speedily top health bars again.

            You also receive a new ability with synergistic talents in Ultimate Penitence which can provide a
            substantial amount of damage but also has some tremendous risks associated with it (see the rotation/talent
            sections).

            More Facts and Background about Discipline Priest
            Fantasy: A strong believer in the light - almost zealous in their belief, causing them to feel no remorse
            about damaging enemies of the light. A Discipline priest is a battle healer, smiting down their enemies in
            order to bravely save their allies. They have adopted the traits of both healing and shadow priests in order
            to make sure their allies stay alive. The main thing that makes Disc Priests truly special is Atonement.
            Races: All races can be Priests.
            Resources: Disc Priests use mana as their resource for spells.
            Damage Reduction: Focused Will is a passive personal damage taken reduction from melee hits. Pain
            Suppression is a strong single target damage reduction spell as well as Power Word: Barrier being strong for
            a group setting.
            Healing: Using their Power Words such as Power Word: Shield to shield allies and Power Word: Radiance to
            heal allies, Discipline Priests' true strength lies in Atonement which makes the damage you do, heal your
            allies.
            Basic Rotation: Not overcapping Power Word: Radiance charges, maintaing Shadow Word: Pain on the primary
            enemy. Maintain Atonement on the tank, prepare large-scale Atonement on the party before incoming damage via
            (Spell #186263) or Power Word: Shield, then Power Word: Radiance, extend their duration with Evangelism then
            deal damage through Schism, Penance and Smite.
            Mobility: Angelic Feather and Body and Soul are both on the same talent row. These are used for mobility if
            needed.
            Healing Cooldowns: Rapture is a strong Cooldown for Disc Priests. While it does no direct healing, it allows
            you to shield many members of your raid.
            Armor: Intellect Cloth
            Flavor: Priests have a variety of vanity glyphs:
            Glyph of the Heavens to float your Levitate targets on clouds
            Glyph of the Sha to change the appearance of your Shadowfiend
            Glyph of Shackle Undead to change the appearance of your Shackle Undead spell
            Glyph of Ghostly Fade to have a more spectral looking Fade!
            And some toys as well:
            Thaumaturgist's Orb: Summons holy orbs or ravens. Sold by Quartermaster Miranda Breechlock in Light's Hope.
            Scarlet Confessional Book: effect of old Glyph of Confession. Sold by Cravitz Lorent in Dalaran.
