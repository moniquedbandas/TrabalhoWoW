        Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. is an American video game developer and publisher based in Irvine, California. A
        subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, the company was founded in February 1991 as Silicon & Synapse, Inc. by three
        graduates of the University of California, Los Angeles: Michael Morhaime, Frank Pearce and Allen Adham. The
        company originally concentrated on the creation of game ports for other studios' games before beginning
        development of their own software in 1993, with games like Rock n' Roll Racing and The Lost Vikings. In 1993,
        the company became Chaos Studios, Inc., and then Blizzard Entertainment soon after being acquired by distributor
        Davidson & Associates early in the following year. Shortly after, Blizzard released Warcraft: Orcs & Humans.
        <br>
        <br>
        Since then, Blizzard Entertainment has created several Warcraft sequels, including highly influential massively
        multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft in 2004, as well as three other multi-million selling
        video game franchises: Diablo, StarCraft and Overwatch. Their most recent projects include the online
        collectible card game Hearthstone; the multiplayer online battle arena Heroes of the Storm; the remaster of the
        original StarCraft and its expansion Brood War, StarCraft: Remastered; the replacement and sequel to the
        multiplayer first-person hero shooter Overwatch, Overwatch 2; the ninth expansion for World of Warcraft,
        Dragonflight; and the sequel to Diablo III, Diablo IV. The games operate through Blizzard's online gaming
        service Battle.net.
        <br>
        <br>
        On July 9, 2008, Activision merged with Vivendi Games, culminating in the inclusion of the Blizzard brand name
        in the title of the resulting holding company. On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase
        of 429 million shares from the majority owner Vivendi, which resulted in Activision Blizzard becoming a
        completely independent company. Since 2018, the company's reputation has suffered from a series of poorly
        received games, controversies involving players and staff, and allegations of sexual harassment and other
        misconduct against leading Blizzard employees. In October 2023, Microsoft acquired parent company Activision
        Blizzard, maintaining that the company will continue to operate as a separate business. While part of the larger
        Microsoft Gaming division, Blizzard Entertainment retains its function as the publisher of games developed by
        their studios.

        Blizzard Entertainment hosts annual gaming conventions for fans to meet and to promote their games: the first
        BlizzCon was held in October 2005 at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, which is where all of
        their conventions have been held since. BlizzCon features game-related announcements, previews of upcoming
        Blizzard Entertainment games and content, Q&A sessions and panels, costume contests, and playable demos of
        various Blizzard games. Blizzard WorldWide Invitationals were events similar to BlizzCon held in South Korea and
        France between 2004 and 2008.

        <br>
        Main franchises
        The majority of the games Blizzard published are in the Warcraft, Diablo, and StarCraft series. Since the
        release of Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (1994), Diablo (1997), and StarCraft (1998), the focus has been almost
        exclusively on those three franchises. Overwatch (2016) became an exception years later, bringing the number of
        main franchises to four. Each franchise is supported by other media based around its intellectual property such
        as novels, collectible card games, comics and video shorts. Blizzard announced in 2006 that they would be
        producing a Warcraft live-action movie. The movie was directed by Duncan Jones, financed and produced by
        Legendary Pictures, Atlas Entertainment, and others, and distributed by Universal Pictures. It was released
        in June 2016. On October 4, 2022 Overwatch servers were officially shut off, Later Overwatch 2 (2022)
        servers went up.
        <br>
        <br>
        Spin-offs
        Blizzard has released two spin-offs to the main franchises: Hearthstone (2014), which is set in the existing
        Warcraft lore, and Heroes of the Storm (2015), which features playable characters from all four of Blizzard's
        franchises.
        <br>
        <br>
        Remasters
        In 2015, Blizzard Entertainment formed "Classic Games division", a team focused on updating and remastering some
        of their older titles, with an initially announced focus on StarCraft: Remastered (2017), Warcraft III: Reforged
        (2020), and Diablo II: Resurrected (2021).
        <br>
        <br>
        Re-released games
        In February 2021, Blizzard Entertainment released a compilation called Blizzard Arcade Collection for Microsoft
        Windows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. The collection includes five Blizzard's classic video
        games: The Lost Vikings, Rock n' Roll Racing, Blackthorne, The Lost Vikings 2 and RPM Racing, with the last two
        games added in April 2021. Some of the modern features include 16:9 resolution, 4-player split-screen, rewinding
        and saving of game progress, watching replays, and adding graphic filters to change the look of player's
        game. Additionally, it contains upgrades for each game such as enhanced local multiplayer for The Lost
        Vikings, new songs and artist performances for Rock n' Roll Racing, as well as a new level map for
        Blackthorne. A digital museum, which is included in the collection, features game art, unused content, and
        interviews.
        <br>
        <br>
        Unreleased and future games
        Notable unreleased titles include Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans, which was canceled on May 22, 1998,
        Shattered Nations, and StarCraft: Ghost, which was "Postponed indefinitely" on March 24, 2006, after being in
        development hell for much of its lifespan. After seven years of development, Blizzard revealed the cancellation
        of an unannounced MMO codenamed Titan on September 23, 2014. The company also has a history of declining to
        set release dates, choosing to instead take as much time as needed, generally saying a given product is "done
        when it's done."

        Pax Imperia II was originally announced as a title to be published by Blizzard. Blizzard eventually dropped Pax
        Imperia II, though, when it decided it might be in conflict with their other space strategy project, which
        became known as StarCraft. THQ eventually contracted with Heliotrope and released the game in 1997 as Pax
        Imperia: Eminent Domain.
        <br>
        <br>
        The company announced in January 2022 that it was near release of another new intellectual property, a survival
        game that had been at work at the studio for nearly five years.
