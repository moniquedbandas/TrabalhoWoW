        Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. is an American video game developer and publisher based in Irvine, California. A
        subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, the company was founded in February 1991 as Silicon & Synapse, Inc. by three
        graduates of the University of California, Los Angeles: Michael Morhaime, Frank Pearce and Allen Adham. The
        company originally concentrated on the creation of game ports for other studios' games before beginning
        development of their own software in 1993, with games like Rock n' Roll Racing and The Lost Vikings. In 1993,
        the company became Chaos Studios, Inc., and then Blizzard Entertainment soon after being acquired by distributor
        Davidson & Associates early in the following year. Shortly after, Blizzard released Warcraft: Orcs & Humans.

        Since then, Blizzard Entertainment has created several Warcraft sequels, including highly influential massively
        multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft in 2004, as well as three other multi-million selling
        video game franchises: Diablo, StarCraft and Overwatch. Their most recent projects include the online
        collectible card game Hearthstone; the multiplayer online battle arena Heroes of the Storm; the remaster of the
        original StarCraft and its expansion Brood War, StarCraft: Remastered; the replacement and sequel to the
        multiplayer first-person hero shooter Overwatch, Overwatch 2; the ninth expansion for World of Warcraft,
        Dragonflight; and the sequel to Diablo III, Diablo IV. The games operate through Blizzard's online gaming
        service Battle.net.

        On July 9, 2008, Activision merged with Vivendi Games, culminating in the inclusion of the Blizzard brand name
        in the title of the resulting holding company. On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase
        of 429 million shares from the majority owner Vivendi, which resulted in Activision Blizzard becoming a
        completely independent company. Since 2018, the company's reputation has suffered from a series of poorly
        received games, controversies involving players and staff, and allegations of sexual harassment and other
        misconduct against leading Blizzard employees. In October 2023, Microsoft acquired parent company Activision
        Blizzard, maintaining that the company will continue to operate as a separate business. While part of the larger
        Microsoft Gaming division, Blizzard Entertainment retains its function as the publisher of games developed by
        their studios.

        Blizzard Entertainment hosts annual gaming conventions for fans to meet and to promote their games: the first
        BlizzCon was held in October 2005 at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, which is where all of
        their conventions have been held since.[10] BlizzCon features game-related announcements, previews of upcoming
        Blizzard Entertainment games and content, Q&A sessions and panels, costume contests, and playable demos of
        various Blizzard games. Blizzard WorldWide Invitationals were events similar to BlizzCon held in South Korea and
        France between 2004 and 2008.
