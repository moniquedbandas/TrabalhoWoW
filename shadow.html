        Shadow Priest Overview
        <br>
        <br>
        Shadow Priest is a ranged cloth dps specialisation with a mix of direct damage and damage over time spells.
        The spec predominantly focuses on dealing Shadow damage and most of its defensive capabilities are linked to
        its self healing. Priests in general are very slow, and Shadow is no exception with no baseline displacement
        or movement abilities you'll have to plan movement in encounters ahead of time, as well as use the few
        kiting tools you have available to their maximum advantage. Shadow Priests also have the ability to empower
        the damage of their allies, as well as themselves, and are a dps spec focused on dealing maximum damage in
        burst windows every minute with numerous stacked cooldowns.
        <br>
        <br>
        More Facts and Background about Shadow
        <br>
        Fantasy: Shadow Priests are priests that use their ties to the void in order to cause pain and suffering to
        their enemies. Most of their spells are either related to hits directly into their foes minds, weakening
        them with every blow or tapping into the power of the void to strike their foes with ancient powers. Like
        other Priest specs, they have the option to heal their allies' wounds, but at a much more expensive cost.
        Shadow Priests can also convert the pain of their enemies into salvation for their allies, using vampiric
        rituals. The main thing that makes Shadow Priests truly special is Voidform.
        <br>
        <br>
        Resources: Shadow Priests use both Insanity and Mana as resources. As a Shadow Priest, you will be casting
        abilities which generate Insanity. Insanity can be spent using Devouring Plague or (Spell #48045). Mana is
        used to cast Flash Heal and Power Word: Shield.
        <br>
        Mobility: Shadow Priests have a low level of mobility which can be increased slightly by either Body and
        Soul or Dispersion (not advised).
        <br>
        AoE Capabilities: Multi-dotting with Shadow Word: Pain, Vampiric Touch, and using (Spell #48045) are how
        Shadow Priests cause damage to large groups of mobs.
        <br>
        <br>
        Defensive Abilities:
        <br>
        Dispersion: The big personal cooldown for shadow. Baseline it's at 75% damage
        reduction. Lasts 6 seconds on a 2m cooldown. Very useful for surviving things that would otherwise kill you.
        <br>
        Armor: Intellect Cloth
        <br>
        Weaknesses: Shadow Priests are currently weak in burst AoE and ST situations
        <br>
        Flavor: Priests have a variety of vanity glyphs:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Glyph of the Heavens to float your Levitate targets on clouds</li>
            <li>Glyph of the Sha to change the appearance of your Shadowfiend</li>
            <li>Glyph of Shackle Undead to change the appearance of your Shackle Undead spell</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        And some toys as well:
        <br>
        Thaumaturgist's Orb: Summons holy orbs or ravens. Sold by Quartermaster Miranda Breechlock in Light's Hope.
        <br>
        Scarlet Confessional Book: effect of old Glyph of Confession. Sold by Cravitz Lorent in Dalaran.
        <br>
        What defines Priests who select the Shadow specialization is their signature ability Voidform. This gives
        allows the Priest to tap deeper into the powers of the Void should they choose to, giving a translucent
        appearance and making their void powers manifest to the outside world, with some tentacles as a side effect.
